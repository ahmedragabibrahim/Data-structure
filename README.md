# Data-structure
the first programe called graph is about an amazing technique called (BFS) BFS is the most commonly used approach. BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph layerwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node).
the second one is about linear data structure called singly linked list this program insert a node in specific location between 2_nodes
